# Hello there! 👋🏻  
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────<br>
I am Vaibhav Kale, a Final-Year Student at Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (IITD), majoring in Biochemical and Biotechnology Engineering with a Minor in Computer Science. My academic and professional journey has been fueled by a passion for technology, programming, and problem-solving.<br>

Some of the courses I am pursuing during my undergraduate studies include Data Structures and Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Database Management Systems, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Blockchain Technology, and Software Engineering. These have laid a strong foundation for my interests in software development, blockchain, and data analytics, which I thoroughly enjoy applying to real-world challenges.<br>

I am a passionate table tennis player, having represented IIT Delhi at the Inter IIT Sports Meet. When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new places with friends and embracing new experiences.
